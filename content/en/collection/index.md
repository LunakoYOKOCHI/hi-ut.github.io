The Historiographical Institute has an extensive collection of documents, diaries, and other historical materials, including a National Treasure and designated Important Cultural Properties. The Institute also maintains an up-to-date collection of modern scholarly monographs and academic journals related to Japanese history. All of these items are cared for and managed by the Institute's Library.

A wide variety of materials can be accessed in the Institute library. These include original documents, replicas, photo reproductions, microfilm and sheet-film copies, and CD-ROM materials. The Institute is particularly proud of its strong collection of original materials, acquired over the years through gifts, purchase, and government designation. In addition, all of the tools needed for research on Japanese historical materials can be found in the library, including general and specialized reference works, as well as books and journals in Japanese and Western languages.

To encourage historical studies both within and outside of the university, the library lists many of its holdings with several Internet database search services, including OPAC (the database of books and journals held in the University of Tokyo) and CiNii (a compilation site for libraries throughout Japan), and HI-cat (Historiographical Institute Catalog). <!-- Library staff can assist with reference questions and in special cases prepare photographic reproductions (shashincho) of some materials. -->

The Institute's library welcomes scholars who wish to use the collections for their research, though certain restrictions apply.

<h3 class="h04 mt2">An Important Cultural Property – the “Jichin Kasho Musoki”</h3>

The “Jichin Kasho Musoki” (“Dream of the Monk Jichin”) is a work that records a “dream” of Jien (1155-1225, also known as Jichin Kasho), the Senior Abbott of the Tendai Sect of Buddhism during the late Heian period and early Kamakura period. Jien is famed for his historical work “Gukansho” (“Jottings of a Fool”), in which he vividly outlines the historical events of his own era, describing the political developments from his perspective as a scion of the important Fujiwara family of regents, and reflecting on the forces that drive historical change. The work is best known for a section which comments on the transfer of effective power to the warrior class in the aftermath of the Hogen Rebellion of 1156. However, the work also has immensehistorical importance because of the way it uses the impact of the loss of the Kusanagi sword (one of the three Imperial Regalia of Japan) during the climactic battle that saw the downfall of the Taira (Heike) clan in 1185 to develop a philosophical approach aimed at explaining the emergence of the new era in which the warrior class was now dominant. This ancient handwritten manuscript, which may have been written by Jien himself, was formerly held at the Shoren-in Temple in Kyoto, to which Jien bequeathed it. In 2014, the work was designated by the Japanese government as an important cultural property.
