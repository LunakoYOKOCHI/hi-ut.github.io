The Meiji Government took over the operation of this institute in the second year of the Meiji period (1869) and embarked on historiographical undertakings. The institute was subsequently transferred to the Imperial University, which adopted the current style of compiling and studying Japanese historical materials. Starting with the first volumes of Dai Nihon Shiryō and Dai Nihon Komonjo published in 1901, we have published a total of more than 1,200 volumes of Japanese historical materials and archives."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"　Many historical materials related to Japanese history can be found in both Japan and overseas. Investigation and collection of these materials are the first steps to historiographical undertakings. In recording such historical information, we have adopted the most appropriate method available at the time such as calligraphic reproduction, copying, and photography, according to the characteristics of the historical material. With the digitalization of photography of recent years, we have established a new framework to systematically accumulate and publish high-definition photographs of historical materials. In addition to reproduced materials, the Historiographical Institute also has a vast archive of 200,000 precious original source materials including a designated National Treasure, the Shimazu-ke Monjo (Documents of the Shimazu Family). We repair and conserve these materials to pass them down to the next generation and also analyze the unique information only original materials bear, integrating conservation and research together as a consistent endeavor."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"　The Historiographical Institute has made active efforts to expand our scope of research and to innovate the ways we disseminate information. In 1997, we established the Center for the Study of Visual Sources to engage in full-fledged research of pictorial sources such as picture scrolls, shoen-ezu (ancient and medieval estate maps) and old photographs. The International Center for the Digitization of Premodern Japanese Sources was established in 2006 to expand the Siryohensansho Historical Information Processing System (SHIPS) we have built and evolved since the 1980s and pioneer the new field of historical informatics. We also contribute to the internationalization of Japanese history such as investigations of Japanese historical materials held overseas and international dissemination of Japanese history information. Through these activities, we have deepened collaboration with overseas institutions that hold historical materials or engage in historiography in diverse countries, including those in China, Korea and Russia. Certified as a “research center for converting Japanese historical materials into research resources” since 2009, we have promoted collaborative research with researchers, museums, and regional authorities throughout Japan and the findings from such collaborations are offered as research resources for joint use. In 2019, we were selected as the only humanities institute in the Program for Constructing Data Infrastructure for the Humanities and Social Sciences by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science and have embarked on the construction of data infrastructure on Japanese historical materials, aiming to strengthen the core values of data sharing, internationalization, and connectivity.
