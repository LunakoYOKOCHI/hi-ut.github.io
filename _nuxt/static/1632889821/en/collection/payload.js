Jien is famed for his historical work “Gukansho” (“Jottings of a Fool”), in which he vividly outlines the historical events of his own era, describing the political developments from his perspective as a scion of the important Fujiwara family of regents, and reflecting on the forces that drive historical change. The work is best known for a section which comments on the transfer of effective power to the warrior class in the aftermath of the Hogen Rebellion of 1156. However, the work also has immensehistorical importance because of the way it uses the impact of the loss of the Kusanagi sword (one of the three Imperial Regalia of Japan) during the climactic battle that saw the downfall of the Taira (Heike) clan in 1185 to develop a philosophical approach aimed at explaining the emergence of the new era in which the warrior class was now dominant.
